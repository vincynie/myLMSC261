 # Final Project Proposal
 1. Description of the deliverable
 ## A series of generative art paintings that involve some sort of randomness to heal people with depression

 2. What problem does the project solve?
 ## I hope this series of generative art paintings could help people with depression to feel better, especially more peaceful inside. I hope the randomness and the beauty of the paintings could tell them that life can be beautiful and meaningful even with randomness and triviality.

 3.  What resources will you use?
 ## (I found these resources online for now, but I might find more helpful ones in the future)

4. What are the use cases (who is your "audience"?)
 ## My best friend Casey and people who suffer from depression are the main audience. Casey is the one who gave me the inspiration. She suffers from high - functioning depression for a long time, at least a year or so. Every time when she's in a really bad state, I would feel guilty about not able to help her coming out of the negative emotions. I tried every method I could find, but none worked. I know she also gets help from her therapist, but I just hope that I could do more. One day when she texted me a bunch of art pieces / paintings and said that these paintings reminded her that life can be beautiful. I suddenly realized that she might need some stimulations from art or anything that could indirectly tell her that life can be beautiful and meaningful. We all know that people who suffer from depression tend to think that life is meaningless, so I hope some generative art pieces with some random elements could remind them the opposite.

5. Timeline
 ## Starting from next week, there're five weeks time in total till the end of this semester, so I'm going to make this timeline in terms of weeks.

 ## Week 1 & 2 (March 29th, April 5th)
Research:
I'm going to do more research on cases people have done and tried to make my idea more complete and grounded. I would add more details in terms of exactly what type of paintings I wanna create and hopefully decide what type of random elements I wanna add.

Week 2 & 3 (April 5th,  April 12nd)
Coding:
After adding more details to my original idea, I would start coding.

Week 4 (April 19th)
Coding & Debugging:
I think there will definitely be problems coming out during the process, so this week is for those problems.

Week 5 (April 26)
Finishing up & Getting some user feedback:
After debugging, everything should be in place exactly the way I want. I think I want some user feedback, so I would show my work to my best friend Casey and see what she thinks about it and whether it's effective.

Week 6 (May 3rd)
Presenting:
I don't know if we're going to present our final project on May 3rd. If not, I would change my timeline accordingly.

6. How do you think you should be assessed?
 ## I think the final project grading rubric works for me. If anything specific to my project, I would say it's my audience's feedback. I would hope that my audience is satisfied with what I've done and that the paintings are truly helpful.
