 # Github Troll Review Assignment
 The github I'm watching is called kosmos/awesome-generative-art. It is a project that has lots of helpful resources for creating generative art. From what I observed, there are mainly four changed being made among the collaborators. The first one is a few website links being added to the main branch. They are about openFrameworks tutorials series. The second change is about the readme file. One of the collaborators added more details of the outline of the resources including adding anchor to websites. The third change is about adding Isadora as a visual programming language to the sources. This collaborator commented that "Its built in scene structure makes composing a show with numerous elements very easy." The last change is about updating a broken link in the markdown file.

 Through my observation, it seems like it's very easy and convenient to communicate and add comments and thoughts to the already established projects or forums on github. It's also very free in terms of adding new resources or fixing some broken errors or updating anything.
