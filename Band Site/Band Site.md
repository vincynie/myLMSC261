 # Band Site Assignment
 1. A hyperlink to the site you all made
 https://mlayese.github.io

 2. Problems faced, decisions made (as in other weeks)
 I encountered mainly two problems while working on this project. The first one was that I didn't create a branch and did all of my changes from the main branch, which led to the fact that my other two teammates couldn't revise or merge anything. After realizing this issue, I created my own branch and everything worked out. The second problem was that the hyperlink I tried to add didn't work. I asked my other two teammates and also googled and got the answer.

 3. A self-assessment of how you contributed to the group
 I contributed to the group by first providing ideas about the band name and the style of the website. Then, I did my paragraph and added a hyper link as an asset to the website.

 4. Short assessments of your group members and the contributions they made
Myron created the style and format of the website. He also added the audio as an asset.
David created a paragraph for himself and a picture.
We all helped each other in the process and decided the style of the website together.
