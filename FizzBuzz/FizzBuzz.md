I first thought about how to define the location of those three words and then thought about the calculation part. I didn't really have any problems during the coding part.
However, I couldn't make it run in terminal. It kept showing me this "no such file or directory" error message. After tried a thousand times, I finally realized I probably should save the .py file first and then write the codes. What I did was I wrote the codes first and then saved it. That's probably where went wrong. Now I know that the order of doing things is extremely important.
