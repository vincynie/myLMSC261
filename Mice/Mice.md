  2. There are various representations of one letter
  ⋅⋅1. the signal from the keyboard
  ⋅⋅2. the version in memory
  ⋅⋅3. the lines-and-circles version sketched on the screen
  3. The computer also considers different ways to store data

 # 2.2 From Hardware to Software
  1. Expectations around software have changed over time.
  2. Today, much hardware comes with some software.
  3. People are trying to make software easier to write and code in plain English.
  4. Beginning in the 1950s, people start to invent ways to satisfy basic human desires by controlling the machine.

  # 2.3 How Does Code Become software
  1. Code is a sequence of symbols that someone typed in, or copied, or pasted from elsewhere.
  2. The goal is to turn your code into an explicit list of instructions that can turn into something that can be executed: software.
  3. A compiler is a software that takes the symbols you typed into a file and transforms them into lower-level instructions.
  4. The process of going character by character can be wrapped up into a routine, also called a function, a method, a subroutine, or component.
  5. You can print anything you wish
  6. You can repeat the process forever

  # 2.4 What Is an Algorithm?
  1. An algorithm solves a problem and it gets named.
  2. A programming language is an algorithm management system for encoding, naming, and organizing algorithms for reuse and application.
  3. A huge part of computer science is about understanding the efficiency of algorithms: how long they will take to run.

  # 2.5 The Sprint
  1. The functional specification is a set of at least a thousand statements about users clicking buttons.

  # 2.6 What's With All These Conferences, Anyway?
  1. Acculturation and affirming tribal identity
  2. The average programmer is capable of basic math, has knowledge of one or more programming languages, and can communicate what he or she is doing to management and peers.
